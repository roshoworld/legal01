# Court Automation Hub - Document Analysis Plugin

## Version 1.1.7 - CSV Export Download Fix

### 🔧 Fix: CSV Export File Download

**ISSUE RESOLVED**: Fixed CSV export opening in browser instead of downloading as file.

**Problem**: 
- CSV export was displaying content in browser instead of triggering download
- Headers were being sent after HTML output had already started

- ✅ **Added UTF-8 BOM** - improved Excel compatibility for German characters
- ✅ **Enhanced debug logging** - added logging for CSV export requests

**Technical Changes**:
- **CSV export now handled in `admin_init`** instead of during page rendering
- **Proper header sequence** ensures download works correctly
- **Output buffer management** prevents header conflicts
- **Enhanced file naming** with timestamps

**Files Modified**:
- `class-doc-in-admin.php` - Fixed CSV export handling and added admin_init hook
- `court-automation-hub-document-analysis.php` - Updated version
- `README.md` - Updated documentation

**Result**: CSV export now properly downloads as a file instead of displaying in browser.

## Version 1.1.5 - Force Standalone Mode Access

### 🔧 Fix: Bypass Integration Mode Detection

**ISSUE RESOLVED**: Removed integration mode detection that was preventing access to categories page functionality.

**Problem**: 
- Core plugin was active with `CAH_DocIn_Integration` class present
- Plugin was detecting integration mode and showing "integration mode" message
- But actual integration wasn't working - menu not integrated into core plugin
- Users couldn't access categories page functionality at all

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ **Removed Integration Mode Checks**: All admin pages now show full functionality regardless of core plugin status
- ✅ **Force Standalone Mode**: Categories page always accessible with full functionality
- ✅ **Maintained Core Plugin Compatibility**: Core plugin can still handle integration if needed
- ✅ **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Added logging for troubleshooting

**Changes Made**:
- **Removed integration mode checks** from all admin page callbacks
- **Categories page always accessible** at `admin.php?page=cah-doc-in-categories`
- **Dashboard, settings, and unassigned pages** also always accessible
- **Menu items always registered** with valid callbacks

**User Experience**:
- ✅ **Categories Page**: Full functionality always available
- ✅ **Dashboard**: Complete statistics and management interface
- ✅ **Settings**: Pipedream integration settings accessible
- ✅ **Unassigned Communications**: Full communication management

**Files Modified**:
- `class-doc-in-admin.php` - Removed integration mode detection from all admin pages
- `court-automation-hub-document-analysis.php` - Updated version
- `README.md` - Updated documentation

**Note**: If proper integration with the core plugin is needed later, it should be implemented at the core plugin level, not by blocking access to standalone functionality.

## Version 1.1.4 - Complete Menu Access Fix

### 🔧 Final Fix: WordPress Core Access Denied Error

**ISSUE COMPLETELY RESOLVED**: Fixed "Sorry, you are not allowed to access this page" error from WordPress Core.

**Final Root Cause**: 
- Menu callbacks were not being properly registered or were being removed
- Integration mode detection was preventing menu registration entirely
- WordPress Core couldn't find valid callbacks for registered menu items

**Comprehensive Solution**:
- ✅ **Always Register Menu Items**: Menu items are now ALWAYS registered to prevent wp_die() errors
- ✅ **Graceful Integration Mode Handling**: Integration mode is handled within page callbacks, not during registration
- ✅ **Proper Permission Checks**: All admin pages now have proper `manage_options` capability checks
- ✅ **User-Friendly Integration Messages**: When in integration mode, users see helpful messages instead of errors
- ✅ **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

**How It Works Now**:
1. **Menu Registration**: All menu items are always registered with valid callbacks
2. **Integration Mode Check**: Each page callback checks integration mode when accessed
3. **Graceful Handling**: If integration mode is active, shows informative message instead of error
4. **Standalone Mode**: Full functionality available when not in integration mode

**Page Behavior**:
- **Standalone Mode**: Full categories page functionality
- **Integration Mode**: Shows integration notice with helpful message
- **No Permissions**: Proper WordPress permission error (not wp_die)

**Files Modified**:
- `court-automation-hub-document-analysis.php` - Enhanced initialization logging
- `class-doc-in-admin.php` - Complete menu registration and callback handling overhaul
- `README.md` - Updated documentation

**Debug Features**:
- Admin class constructor logging
- Menu registration detailed logging
- Page access logging for all admin pages
- Integration mode detection logging

## Version 1.1.3 - WordPress Core wp_die() Fix

### 🔧 Critical Fix: WordPress Core Menu Error

**ISSUE RESOLVED**: Fixed WordPress Core error `wp_die()` triggered from `wp-admin/includes/menu.php:380`.

**Problem**: 
- WordPress Core was calling `wp_die()` when accessing `page=cah-doc-in-categories`
- Admin menu callback was being removed by integration mode **after** menu registration
- Race condition between menu registration and integration mode cleanup
- Menu items were registered but callbacks were not available when accessed

**Root Cause**:
- `remove_action('admin_menu', ...)` was called **after** the `admin_menu` hook had already executed
- This left menu items registered but without valid callbacks
- WordPress Core triggered `wp_die()` when trying to call non-existent callbacks

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ **Fixed Integration Mode Logic**: Check integration mode **during** menu registration, not after
- ✅ **Removed Race Condition**: Eliminated `remove_action()` calls that happened too late
- ✅ **Proper Menu Registration**: Menu items are only registered if not in integration mode
- ✅ **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Added detailed logging for menu registration process

**Code Changes**:
```php
// OLD (problematic):
remove_action('admin_menu', array($this->admin, 'add_admin_menu'));

// NEW (fixed):
if (class_exists('CAH_DocIn_Integration')) {
    error_log('CAH Doc-In: Integration mode detected - skipping standalone menu');
    return;
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `court-automation-hub-document-analysis.php` - Removed problematic `setup_integration_mode()` method
- `class-doc-in-admin.php` - Fixed menu registration logic with proper integration mode check

**Debug Features**:
- Menu registration logging
- Integration mode detection logging  
- Callback availability verification

**Problem**:

- Admin menu was conditionally loaded based on core plugin integration status
- Race condition between menu registration and integration mode detection

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ **Fixed Menu Registration**: Ensured admin menu is always registered initially
- ✅ **Improved Integration Detection**: Added proper integration mode detection with debug logging
- ✅ **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling to categories page
- ✅ **Added Debug Logging**: Implemented detailed logging for troubleshooting
- ✅ **Permission Checks**: Added proper user capability validation

- Error logging for plugin initialization
