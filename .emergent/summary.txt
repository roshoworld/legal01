The previous AI engineer successfully initiated a complex WordPress plugin suite project. Initially, the focus was on extracting, organizing, renaming, and versioning seven independent plugins (, , , , , , ). This involved installing necessary system dependencies (unzip, PHP) and developing a  script.

Subsequently, the project shifted to implementing a unified menu system and core functionalities. The engineer consolidated menus under Legal Automation, enhanced case management (creation, deletion), improved CRM contacts with tabs, and integrated finance features. A significant portion of the work involved persistent debugging and iterative fixes related to WordPress's menu system, class loading, database operations (especially purging demo data with foreign key constraints), and handling redirects. Despite numerous attempts, the Case Editing functionality remained problematic due to a persistent WordPress core permission error related to parameterized URLs, which the engineer explicitly identified as the final outstanding architectural challenge. The AI engineer demonstrated an iterative problem-solving approach, frequently adjusting tactics based on user feedback and debug logs.

The user, a non-technical individual, manages a legal tech SaaS called Rosho.App using a WordPress plugin suite. The core problem is organizing and enhancing seven interconnected plugins: , , , , , , and .

Initial requirements focused on project organization:
*   Extract zipped plugins into seven independent subfolders: , , , , , , .
*   Apply specific naming conventions (Rule #9) for , , , : . , ,  were already correct.
*   Increment versioning for changed PHP headers (Rule #1).
*   Maintain a clean main  folder.
*   Mandatory pre-deployment validation using Usage: python3 validate-deployment.py /path/to/plugin VERSION with ≥95% confidence score (Rule #12).

Subsequent functional requirements include:
*   **Unified Menu:** Merge all existing menus under a single Legal Automation parent menu with sub-items: Dashboard, Fälle (case list), Einstellungen (configuration), Dokumenteneingang (doc-in) with submenus, Dokumenten Generator (doc-out) with submenus, CRM (Kontakte, Gerichte, Historie), Finanzen (Rechner, Templates, Settings).
*   **Case Screen:** Full CRUD for all fields, connect all plugins from a central place, no financials in Beweise tab, CRUD for contacts/courts in all tabs, list view and CRUD for Gerichtstermine, no financial calculations in Partner tab.
*   **Known Issues:** Fix silently failing case creation, fix incorrect totalizer bar, fix Einstellungen demo data problem (duplicate records, wrong mandatory fields) by adding a developer-mode purge button.
*   **Versioning Cleanup:** Remove incorrect version references from plugin headers.

The user handles frontend testing and explicitly requested not to change existing UI/design unless instructed. The work is confined to one plugin at a time, primarily modifying the  plugin.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **WordPress Plugin Development:** Core framework, hooks (e.g., , ), capabilities (, ),  for database interaction.
- **PHP:** Backend logic for plugin functionalities, class-based architecture.
- **MySQL Database:** Data storage, table management,  vs  for data purging, foreign key constraints.
- **File System Operations:** , , file editing for plugin organization and content modification.
- **JavaScript/jQuery:** Frontend dynamic modifications for URL fixing.
- **Deployment & Validation:** Custom Python script for pre-deployment checks, versioning control.

<code_architecture>
The application is structured as a WordPress plugin suite, with each major component residing in its own subfolder within the  directory.



**Key Files and Changes:**

*   Usage: python3 validate-deployment.py /path/to/plugin VERSION
    *   **Summary**: A new Python script created to perform pre-deployment validation checks (PHP syntax, WordPress compliance, naming convention, versioning). It was crucial for ensuring the integrity of the updated plugins.
    *   **Changes Made**: Created from scratch. Initial version had strict PHP error handling that caused false positives, which was later adjusted to ignore specific strict errors.
*   
    *   **Summary**: This is the main file for the Core plugin, serving as the primary entry point and orchestrator for the unified menu and central functionalities.
    *   **Changes Made**:
        *   Updated  and  in the header comments (e.g., from Court Automation Hub v219 to Legal Automation - Core v235).
        *   Includes , , , and .
        *   Initializes  and  within its  method to ensure proper loading and menu integration.
*   
    *   **Summary**: A newly created class centralizing all WordPress admin menu registrations. It's responsible for creating the main Legal Automation menu, its submenus, and aggressively removing individual menus from other integrated plugins to achieve a unified navigation. It also contains settings and purge functionality.
    *   **Changes Made**:
        *   Created from scratch.
        *   Extensively modified throughout the trajectory to add, remove, and refine menu items and their associated page callbacks.
        *   Implemented  with high priority (9999) to ensure other plugin menus are hidden.
        *   Added , , , ,  etc., acting as delegates or direct handlers for content.
        *   Includes the purge functionality and the database diagnostic tool.
*   
    *   **Summary**: This class handles core administrative functions, particularly case management (creation, listing, editing, deletion) and forms.
    *   **Changes Made**:
        *   Modified to integrate with the  for displaying case lists and forms.
        *   Improved  logic for better error handling, success messages, and a mechanism to auto-generate unique case IDs to prevent duplicates.
        *   Added JavaScript snippets to dynamically fix problematic URLs for edit, view, and delete actions within the case list, redirecting them to the correct unified menu URLs (e.g., ).
        *   Adjusted to always load regardless of the admin plugin's active state to ensure its methods are available for the unified menu.
        *   Implemented  to manage case deletion without problematic redirects.
*   
    *   **Summary**: A new class for managing CRM contacts with categorized tabs.
    *   **Changes Made**: Created from scratch to provide , , and  functionalities. Integrated into the unified menu system.
*   
    *   **Summary**: A new utility script providing detailed information about database tables and their contents, along with enhanced purging capabilities.
    *   **Changes Made**: Created from scratch. Offers  and  options for purging, specifically addressing foreign key constraints that prevented  operations on some tables.

<pending_tasks>
- **Case Editing Functionality:** The most critical pending task is resolving the WordPress core permission error that prevents access to the case editing page. This requires an architectural solution (modal editing, AJAX, or proper submenu registration).
- **Testing & Validation:** Comprehensive testing of all CRUD operations and user acceptance testing of the unified interface.
- **Production Readiness:** Remove debug logging and optimize database queries for production deployment.
- **Security Audit:** Perform a security audit of user permissions.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into troubleshooting a persistent Sorry, you are not allowed to access this page error, specifically when attempting to edit cases. This error occurred despite numerous attempts to fix menu registrations, capabilities, and redirect logic across several plugin versions (up to v235).

The  update, the last one before the summary request, aimed to address two specific issues:
1.  **Double Case Creation:** Fixed by introducing  after processing the  POST request in the dashboard's handling logic, preventing the same data from being processed twice by delegation to the core admin.
2.  **Case Editing Permission Error:** The engineer attempted to fix this by enhancing a JavaScript snippet in  and  to dynamically modify *all* problematic links (delete, edit, view) and form actions to point to the correct  or  URLs. This also involved ensuring proper handling of  actions within the  method.

Despite these fixes, the user reported that case edition still triggers Sorry, you are not allowed to access this page. This indicates that the WordPress core menu validation mechanism is still blocking access before the JavaScript or PHP handling logic for editing can even execute. The AI engineer acknowledges this as a deeper, architectural issue requiring a more fundamental solution than previous iterative fixes.
